    <h3>Wannabe Human Being</h3>
    <p>You must be wondering how come a human being can be a "wannabe"? Are you sure that all of the human lookalike creatures meet the criteria to claim 'em  as humans? Well, I'm not sure about it. Therefore, I want to be a good human being, later comes my other intro which is somehow less important to me. I see the world in a naive way, the way you might not ever choose to. In many ways we are similar but different point of views make us apart from the long path of our life. Is life  truly that long? It feels like a fraction of a second to achieve the goal which will perhaps never come true.</p> <p>You'll never know until you open the box of the chocolate.</p>

    <h3>Wannabe Human Being</h3>
    <p>You must be wondering how come a human being can be a "wannabe"? Are you sure that all of the human lookalike creatures meet the criteria to claim 'em  as humans? Well, I'm not sure about it. Therefore, I want to be a good human being, later comes my other intro which is somehow less important to me. I see the world in a naive way, the way you might not ever choose to. In many ways we are similar but different point of views make us apart from the long path of our life. Is life  truly that long? It feels like a fraction of a second to achieve the goal which will perhaps never come true.</p> <p>You'll never know until you open the box of the chocolate.</p>

            <p>I have been learning HTML, CSS and other vital softwares in order to become a professional web developer. Although I am completely new in this field, I am quite hopeful that, with the help of Programming Hero, I would be soon able to become a Programming Heroine(wink wink). Insha Allah my bag of skills is going to be full very soon. Fingers crossed!</p>

            <p>I am currently a student in Batch 3 of Programing Hero where this is my first website I have tried to create. I am trying my best to build a portfolio, which is not much of a bigshot but I am looking forward to making in near future. Go ahead, Samia. You mustn't quit in the middle. If I can build a not-so-posh website now, no brainer I'd be able to do waaay better. All credit goes to Jhankar Bhai.</p>
